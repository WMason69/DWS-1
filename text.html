<h1>The Giant Squid</h1>

<p>The <strong><em>giant squid</em></strong> (genus: Architeuthis) is a deep-ocean dwelling squid in the family Architeuthidae, represented by as many as eight species.</p>

<p>Giant squid can grow to a tremendous size <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep-sea_gigantism">(see Deep-sea gigantism)</a>: recent estimates put the maximum size at 13 m (43 ft) for females and 10 m (33 ft) for males from the posterior fins to the tip of the two long tentacles (second only to the colossal squid at an estimated 14 m (46 ft), one of the largest living organisms). The mantle is about 2 m (6.6 ft) long (more for females, less for males), and the length of the squid excluding its tentacles is about 5 m (16 ft). Claims of specimens measuring 20 m (66 ft) or more have not been scientifically documented.</p>

<p>On <b><i>30 September 2004,</i></b> researchers from the <strong><abbr title="Museum of Nature and Science">NMNS</abbr></strong> <cite>(Museum of Nature and Science)</cite> of Tokyo, Japan and the <strong><abbr title="Ogasawara Whale Watching Association">OWA</abbr></strong> <cite>(Ogasawara Whale Watching Association)</cite> took the first images of a live giant squid in its natural habitat. Several of the 556 photographs were released a year later. The <strong><abbr>NMNS</abbr></strong> and <strong><abbr>OWA</abbr></strong> successfully filmed a live adult giant squid for the first time on <b><i>4 December 2006.</i></b></p>
